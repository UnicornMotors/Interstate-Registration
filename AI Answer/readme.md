answer:
In Louisiana, business vehicles must have Louisiana plates or Louisiana apportioned plates if the owner or lessee is employed or resides in Louisiana. Nonresidents who regularly operate a business or are employed in Louisiana for 30 days or more must also have Louisiana plates or apportioned plates. However, there are some exceptions, such as reciprocal agreements between Louisiana and the nonresident's home state. 
To obtain apportioned plates for a commercial vehicle, you can visit a district office of the Vehicle Registration Bureau. You can also get license plates at a district office for noncommercial vehicles. 
To register a vehicle in Louisiana, you'll need to:
Purchase Louisiana car insurance 
Visit a local OMV office 
Submit registration documents 
Pay the applicable tax, title, and license fees 
You may also need to pay a road use tax if you bring an old car into Louisiana.
